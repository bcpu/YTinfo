Grabs title &amp; description from a youtube video(s). 

About
======

I started this project because one of my clients wanted to upload all of their videos from YouTube to Vimeo. The descriptions weren't carrying over to Vimeo so I started coding this to easily pull the data without having to do it manually for each video.

End Goal
======

I'd like to plug this into Vimeo directly. An example would be you have 10 videos on youtube that you uploaded to Vimeo and you want the descriptions to be the same. The program would parse the video info from youtube and then set it on Vimeo.
